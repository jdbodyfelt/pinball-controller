# Pinball Controller Dimensions

I want to mimic the dimensions of a standard Williams or Stern pinball. At the coin door face, that's 56 cm wide x 40 cm high. For the depth of the box, I want to mimic the depth to the bottom of the playfield / top of the apron - I will be having a TFT installed in the top for cards / setting control. 

That dimension is from typical cab depth minus playfield, which is around 25 cm. That the depth then of our box. However it's sloped. The front face is 40 cm high, but the top needs a 6-7° slope. With 6.5°, that has the back face at 42.85 cm.
